# Data Visualization using Python

Data visualization is the process of representing data using graphics, including charts, dashboards, geospatial, infographics, tables, or even animation. Data visualization helps data professionals see the big picture and tell a story with data, and it also provides an accessible way to view and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. This process allows a way to communicate complex data relationships and links between data points and enables data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.


Some of the common visualization techniques include: 

+ **Tables**: data is structured through columns and rows, but this technique can be overwhelming for users searching for high-level trends
+ **Pie and Stacked Bar Charts**: the graph is divided into sections that represent parts of a whole; these techniques provide a great way to organize data and compare the size of each component with respect to others.
+ **Line and Area Charts**: the graph shows changes in one or more quantities by plotting a series of data points over time; these techniques can be used for predictive analytics
+ **Histograms**: the graph plots the distribution of numbers using a bar chart (with no spaces between the bars); this technique is used to show the quantity of data that falls within a particular range
+ **Heat Maps**: this technique shows the graphical representation that displays behavioral data by location
+ **Tree Maps**: this technique is used to display organizational and hierarchical structure as a set of nested shapes.
+ **Scatter and Bubble Plots**: this technique is used to capture the relationship between a set of variables and is commonly used within regression data analysis.



Python provides a wide range of data visualization libraries:

+ **Altair**: This library is built on top of vega-lite visualization grammar to create complex, layered, and interactive visualizations of data with declarative syntax [learn more about Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io)
+ **Folium**: This library is built on top of leaflet.js library to provide interactive maps and visualizations [learn about Folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/)
+ **Seaborn**: This library provides high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics [learn about Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
+ **Bokeh**: This library helps creating interactive and informative visualizations [learn about Bokeh](http://bokeh.org)
+ **Matplotlib**: This is a popular library used to create a wide range of high-quality 2D & 3D plots, charts, and graphs. This library is used extensively in scientific computing, data analysis, and ML applications  [learn about Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
